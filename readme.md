To use, run npm install, then npx webpack, then node index.js, then open in browser and navigate to localhost:3000


if you want to rebuild the app as you code, install Nodemon (npm install nodemon) and run nodemon index.js, this will reload the server whenever you edit the index.js file.

For the client side, run npx webpack --watch to rebuild the game on any change inside the src/\*.js files
